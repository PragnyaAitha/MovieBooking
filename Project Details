Assumptions made: Movies will run for atleast 7days in a hall.

Improvements can be made:
  1.Using joins instead of using multiple queries
  2.Adding appropriate indices to columns in DB
  3.Ensuring that duplicate entries are not added to dB.
  4.Writing Tests
  5.Ensuring that correct status codes are returned.
